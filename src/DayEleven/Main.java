        !LAW OF DEMETER:
         Don't talk to strangers!. A method should only interact with objects it directly knows i.e. parameters, fields, objects it creates. not deeply nested structures
        !KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
        Favor simple, straightforward solutions over complex ones.
        !YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need it) .
        Don't add functionality until it's acutally required.
        !DRY (DON'T REPEAT YOURSELF):
        Avoid duplication by abstracting reusable code into single, well-defined locations.
        !Cohension:
        A module (class/method) should have a single, focused purpose with closely related responsibilities.
        !Coupling:
        Minimize dependencies btwn modules to make them independent and easier to change.

    ! Cohension: Book focuses on book-related data and state. Member focuses on member details . Each class has a single, clear purpose.
