/*
   * Law of Demeter:
        lendBook only interacts with Book and Member objects directly (via their methods like getName(),
        isAvailable()), not their internal structures. It doesnâ€™t do something like book.getSomeNestedObject().doSomething().
   * DRY:
        The findBookByTitle and findMemberById methods centralize search logic, avoiding repetition in multiple places.
   * KISS:
        The lending logic is straightforward: find the book, find the member, check availability, and update.
   * Cohesion:
        Library focuses solely on managing books and members, not unrelated tasks like sending emails or printing receipts.
   * Low Coupling:
         Library depends only on Book and Member abstractions, not their internals

/*
    YAGNI: For now we will keep it minimal, just lending and displaying books. Extra features can be added later if needed.
